## Google Search Central

**Things we believe you shouldn't focus on :**

- **Meta Keywords**: Google Search doesn't use the keywords meta tag. -**Keyword stuffing**: Overusing keywords on your pages is against Google's spam policies.
- **PageRank**: Google's algorithms rely on more than 200 unique signals and PageRank is just one of those.
- **Number and order of headings**: Google's systems don't evaluate the number of H1 headings or the order of the headings.
- **Minimum or maximum content length**: The length of the content alone doesn't matter for ranking purposes.
- **Keywords in the domain name or URL path**: Keywords in the URL have no bearing on the ranking of your page.
- **Subdomains vs subdirectories**: Google uses equally subdomains and subdirectories.
- **Duplicate content "penalty"**: Google doesn't have a duplicate content penalty. it's not something that will cause a manual action.

**Things we believe you should focus on :**

- **Help Google find your content**: Make sure that Google can find and render your content.
- **Organize your site**: Make your site easier to navigate.
- **Make your site interesting and useful**: Create a useful, information-rich site and write pages that clearly and accurately describe your content.
- **Influence how your site looks in Google Search**: Make sure your site's search snippet looks good.
- **Add images to your site, and optimize them**: Use high-quality images and consider adding useful information in the image filename and alt text.
- **Optimize your videos**: Make your videos embed on a stanaalone page, and use video sitemaps.
- **Promote your website**: Social media promotion, community engagement, and advertisement, both offline and online.

## Medium Blog

Here is a list of important best practices with links where you can read about them in depth:

- `<title>` and `<meta name=”description”>` are the tags controlling how your web page is displayed on Google’s result pages.

- HTML tags like header tags (h1, h2) and HTML attributes like the alt attribute on `<img>` tags, would help to create a structure to your web page so crawlers can interpret your content better.

- Structured Data exposes information from your page like rank, location, opening hours, and prices to appear on Google search pages. The more information appears on the search page, the higher the chance of a web page to be clicked.

- Make the web site mobile friendly.

- Use the HTTPS protocol.

- Make your website accessible to people with disabilities. Not only would your website be accessible to more people, Google would also reward you with a higher rank.

- Use logical and meaningful site hierarchy-
  example.com/RunningShoes/Womens
  instead of
  example.com/123123/123123
- Watch your `<a href>` links-
   - Each link has to have meaningful text.
   - Tell google the nature of your links to external websites using extra attributes on the `<a>` tag. For example, rel=”nofollow” is used to let Google know you are not associated with the website you link to.
   - Make sure every page you want Google to crawl is linked with an `<a href>` from the homepage (possibly through more then one link).
- Make sure your content is not duplicated between different versions so they won’t compete with each other:
  - Use 301 redirects if you’ve restructured your site so both versions won’t get indexed separately and compete with each other.
  - Stick to one version of a website’s link:
    http://www.example.com/page/ or http://www.example.com/page or http://www.example.com/page/index.html
  - Use `<meta rel=”canonical”>` tag to indicate different pages and URLs are holding the same content.
- Localization- Use the hreflang meta tag to tells Google that a web page has different versions in different languages.
- Make your website fast to score high on “Google PageSpeed Insights”. https://www.searchenginejournal.com/technical-seo/page-speed/
