## Performance Metrics

Web performance metrics are quantitative measures of the performance of a web page or application. They are used to assess the speed and efficiency of a web page, and they can help identify areas for improvement. Some common web performance metrics include:

- **Load time**: The time it takes for a web page to load and become interactive.
- **First Contentful Paint (FCP)**: The time it takes for the first piece of content to be rendered on the screen.
- **Time to Interactive (TTI)**: The time it takes for a web page to become fully interactive.
- **First Input Delay (FID)**: The time it takes for the web page to respond to user input for the first time.
- **Total blocking time (TBT)**: The amount of time during which the main thread is blocked and unable to respond to user input.

#### MORE

- **Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)**: The time it takes for the largest piece of content to be rendered on the screen.

- **Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)**: The amount of unexpected layout shifts that occur during the loading of a web page.

- **Time to First Byte (TTFB)**: The time it takes for the server to respond to a request from the client.

- **Interaction to Next Point (INP)**: The time it takes for the web page to respond to user input after the initial interaction.

### Defining metrics

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Is it happening?</td>
    <td>Did the navigation start successfully? Has the server responded?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is it useful?</td>
    <td>Has enough content rendered that users can engage with it?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is it usable?</td>
    <td>Can users interact with the page, or is it busy?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Is it delightful?</td>
    <td>Are the interactions smooth and natural, free of lag and jank?</td>
  </tr>
