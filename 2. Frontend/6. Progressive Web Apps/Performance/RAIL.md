## RAIL Model

The RAIL model is a performance optimization model for web applications that focuses on improving the perceived performance of a web page.

- **Response**: The time it takes for the web page to respond to user input should be under 100 milliseconds.
- **Animation**: The time it takes for an animation to run should be under 10 milliseconds.
- **Idle**: The web page should take advantage of idle time to perform non-critical tasks.
- **Load**: The time it takes for the web page to fully load should be under 1 second.

The RAIL model is designed to provide a framework for optimizing the performance of a web page by focusing on the four key areas that impact the user’s perception of performance. It is particularly useful for applications that require high levels of interactivity, such as games and social media applications.
