## DevTools

Most of the browsers have built-in developer tools that help you perform web development specific tasks on a webpage. My personal recommendation would be to use Chrome DevTools as it is the most advanced and has the most features. However, if you are using a different browser, you can still use the DevTools to debug your web application.

Chrome DevTools is a set of web development tools built into the Google Chrome browser. It allows web developers to debug and optimize web pages by providing a range of features for inspecting and manipulating the page’s HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Some of the features provided by Chrome DevTools include:

- **Console panel**: View and debug JavaScript errors and log messages.
- **Elements panel**: Inspect and modify the page’s HTML and CSS.
- **Network panel**: Monitor network requests and responses, and analyze performance issues.
- **Performance panel**: Analyze the performance of the page and identify bottlenecks.
- **Application panel**: Inspect the page’s resources, such as cookies and local storage.

#### OTHERS

- **Sources panel**: Debug JavaScript code and set breakpoints.
- **Memory panel**: Analyze memory usage and identify memory leaks.
- **Recording panel**: Record and analyze user interactions with the page.
- **Security panel**: View information about the page’s security and SSL certificate.
